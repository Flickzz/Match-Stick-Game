# Console Based Match Stick Game

## Game Break Down
Play against a computer that **knows** what it's doing, give it an inch and it'll take a mile!

You're given a random set of matches and a choice of who goes first, *pick carefully* otherwise the computer is guaranteed a win!

You win when the computer can't make anymore moves, and zero match sticks remain.

## Development
- As previously mentioned, this is a console based game.
- It was a usefull project I worked on to improve my understanding of c++ and was a fun and interactive challenge
