# Console Based Match Stick Game

## Game Break Down
    Play against a computer that knows what it's doing, give it an inch and it'll take a mile!
    You're given a random set of matches and a choice of who goes first, *pick carefully* otherwise the computer is guaranteed a win!
    You win when there zero matches for the computer to remove upon its turn.

## Development
    - As previously mentioned, this is a console based game.
    - It was a usefull project I worked on to improve my understanding of c++ with a fun and interactive challenge
